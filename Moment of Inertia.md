# Moment of Inertia

The moment of inertia is measures how easy it is to spin an object. Using the torque force analogy, the moment of inertia is like the mass of an object except for torque.

The moment of inertia of an object depends what pivot point you use to spin the object.

You will not be excepted to memorize the moment of inertia for complex objects on the AP exam.

## Point Mass

The moment of inertia of a point mass (one whose mass is concentrated on a single point) is

$$\Huge I = mr^2$$

> **LEGEND:**
> $I$ - Moment of inertia of the point mass.
> $m$ - Mass of the point mass.
> $r$ - Distance from the point mass to the pivot point.

## [[Parallel Axis Theorem]]

## Superposition

Moment of inertia follows superposition, meaning given a complex object made up of smaller objects, the net $I$ at a given pivot for the complex object is equal to the sum of all the individual object's $I$ around the pivot. 

$$\huge I_\text{net} = I_1 + I_2 + I_3 + \ldots$$
