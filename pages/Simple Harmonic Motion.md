# Simple Harmonic Motion

Simple harmonic motion, also abbreviated as **SHM**, is motion in which a restoring force is directly proportional to the displacement of the object.

Nature's response to a disturbance is often simple harmonic motion.

## Forms of Simple Harmonic Motion

\begin{aligned}
x = Acos(\omega t) \\
x = Asin(\omega t) \\
\end{aligned}
$$

## Period and Frequency

Period ($T$ : Scalar) - The time it takes for on oscillation to reach it's original state. For SHM, the period is the time it takes for an object starting at some position to return to that same position.

$$T = \frac{2 \pi}{\omega}$$

Frequency ($f$ : Scalar) - The number of oscillations per second.
