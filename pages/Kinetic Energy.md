# Kinetic Energy

**Kinetic Energy** ($K$ : Scalar | $J$) - The energy an object holds by virtue of the object's velocity.

Since it takes energy to stop a moving object, moving object must be carrying energy. This energy is called kinetic energy.

$$\Huge K = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$$

> **LEGEND:**
> $m$ - Mass of the moving object.
> $v$ - Velocity of the moving object.
