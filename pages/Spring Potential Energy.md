# Spring Potential Energy

The potential energy of a spring is

$$\Huge U_s = \frac{1}{2}kx^2$$
> **LEGEND:**
> $-$ - Negative means the force points towards the equilibrium position.
> $k$ - Spring constant, which depends on the spring's material makup.
> $x$ - Distance that the end of the spring is pull away from the equilibrium position.

> **NOTE:**
> This is derived from the work done by compressing a spring. Since the work is the area under the curve of a force vs displacement graph and this type of graph for a spring is a triangle,
