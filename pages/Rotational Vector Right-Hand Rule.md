# Rotational Vector Right-Hand Rule

For rotational vectors they have a magnitude that describes the rotation, and a direction that points perpendicularly to the rotation.

To find the direction of a rotational vector, curl you fingers around in the direction of the vector and point your thumb outwards. Your thumb will point in the direction of the vector.
 
If the rotational vector has a negative magnitude, the direction of the vector will point in the opposite direction with the same magnitude expect positive.
