# Gravity

Gravity is a universal force that pulls objects together depends on the mass.

**Gravitational Acceleration** ($g$ : Vector | $\frac{m}{s^2}$) - The average acceleration due to gravity near the surface of a large object. Gravitational acceleration will depend on the mass of the large object.

The gravitational acceleration on earth is around $9.8 \frac{m}{s}$. That is,

$$\Huge g_\text{earth} = 9.8$$
