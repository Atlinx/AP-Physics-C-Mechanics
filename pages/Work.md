# Work

Work is the amount of force exerted through a displacement.

$$
\Large
\begin{aligned}
W &= \vec F \cdot \vec{\Delta x} \\
W &= F \Delta x \cos \theta \\
\end{aligned}$$

Assuming the distance an object travels is parallel to the force exerted on it, the work done is the area under the curve of a force versus distance graph. 

This is because

$$\Large W = \int F(x) \cdot dx$$
