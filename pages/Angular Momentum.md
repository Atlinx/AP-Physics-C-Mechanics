# Angular Momentum

**Angular Momentum** ($L$ : Vector | $\frac{N}{m} \cdot s$) - Linear momentum is a measurement of mass in translational motion. The more momentum an object has, the harder it is to stop the object from moving.

As with other rotational vectors, angular momentum uses the [[Rotational Vector Right-Hand Rule]] to determine its direction.

$$\Huge L = I \omega$$

> **LEGEND:**
> $L$ - Angular momentum of the object.
> $I$ - Moment of inertia of the object.
> $\omega$ - Angular velocity of the object.

> **NOTE:**
> Notice that this closely follows the [[Linear Momentum]] formula, since $I$ is the rotational equivalent of $m$ and $\omega$ is the rotational equivalent of $v$.

## Angular Impulse

**Angular Impulse** ($\Delta L$ : Vector | $\frac{N}{m}  \cdot s$) - Linear impulse is a change in momentum.

As with other rotational vectors, angular impulse uses the [[Rotational Vector Right-Hand Rule]] to determine its direction.

Linear impulse is also known as a force exerted through time, which in equation form is

$$\Huge \Delta L = \tau\Delta t$$

> **LEGEND:**
> $\Delta L$ - Angular impulse of the object.
> $\tau$ - Torque exerted on the object.
> $t$ - Time during which the torque is exerted on the object

## Conservation of Angular Momentum

In a closed system, angular momentum is always conserved. That is when a collision occurs,

$$\Huge L_0 = L_f$$

> **LEGEND:**
> $L_0$ - Net angular momentum of the closed system before the collision.
> $L_f$ - Net angular momentum of the closed system after the collision.

> **NOTE:**
> If any objects are  "fixed" in place and cannot spin, then angular momentum is not conserved. An example of a "fixed" object could be a wall.
> 
> Pinned objects do not exist in real life however (a wall would transfer any momentum it recieves from a ball bounce into the earth), therefore momentum is always conserved in real life.
