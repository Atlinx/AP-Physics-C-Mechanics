# Linear Momentum

**Linear Momentum** ($p$ : Vector | $kg \cdot s$) - Linear momentum is a measurement of mass in translational motion. The more momentum an object has, the harder it is to stop the object from moving.

$$\Huge p = mv$$

> **LEGEND:**
> $p$ - Linear momentum of the object.
> $m$ - Mass of the object.
> $v$ - Velocity of the object.


## Linear Impulse

**Linear Impulse** ($\Delta p$ : Vector | $kg \cdot s$) - Linear impulse is a change in momentum.

Linear impulse is also known as a force exerted through time, which in equation form is

$$\Huge \Delta p = F\Delta t$$

> **LEGEND:**
> $\Delta p$ - Impulse of the object.
> $F$ - Force exerted on the object.
> $t$ - Time that force is exerted on the object

## Conservation of Linear Momentum

In a closed system, linear momentum is always conserved. That is when a collision occurs,

$$\Huge p_0 = p_f$$

> **LEGEND:**
> $p_0$ - Net linear momentum of the closed system before the collision.
> $p_f$ - Net linear momentum of the closed system after the collision.

> **NOTE:**
> If any objects are "pinned" down or "fixed" in place and cannot move, then linear momentum is not conserved. An example of a "pinned" object could be a wall.
> 
> Pinned objects do not exist in real life however (a wall would transfer any momentum it recieves from a ball bounce into the earth), therefore momentum is always conserved in real life.
