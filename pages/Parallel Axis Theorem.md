# Parallel Axis Theorem

If you know the moment of inertia of an object around one axis $z$, then you can find the moment of inertia of that object around another axis $z'$ that is parallel to $z$.

$$\Huge I = I_\text{0} + mh^2$$

> **LEGEND:**
> $I_\text{0}$ - Moment of inertia of the object around the original axis.
> $m$ - Mass of the object.
> $h$ - Distance from the new axis to the original axis.

This theorem is often used for composite objects that are made up of smaller objects where for each smaller object, its moment of inertia around an axis located on its center of mass is known.
