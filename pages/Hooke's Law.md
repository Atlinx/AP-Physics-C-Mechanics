The force exerted by the spring to return to it's equilibrium position is

$$\Huge F_s = -kx$$
> **LEGEND:**
> $-$ - Negative means the force is a restoring force â€” if you stretch the spring out, it wants to contract.
> $k$ - Spring constant, which depends on the spring's material makup. This is measured in $N/m$.
> $x$ - Distance that the end of the spring is pull away from the equilibrium position.
