# Gravitational Force

The force exerted by gravity on two objects, with each object experiencing this force, is

$$\Huge F_g = -\frac{GmM}{r^2}$$

> **LEGEND:**
> $F_g$ - Gravitational force exerted on both objects.
> $G$ - Gravitational constant, which is around $6.667 \times 10^{-11} \frac{m^3}{kg \cdot s^2}$.
> $m$ - Mass of one object.
> $M$ - Mass of the other object.
> $r$ - Distance between the center of mass of the two objects.
> $-$ - Negative sign indicates that the force attracts both objects together.
