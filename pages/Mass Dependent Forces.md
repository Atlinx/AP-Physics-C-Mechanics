# Mass Dependent Forces

Sometimes, forces may be dependent on the mass of the object.

## Rocket Propulsion

When rockets take off, they generate thrust by burning fuel. This means the fuel inside the rocket depletes over time, thus the mass of the entire rocket depletes over time.

The equation for rocket propulsion is

$$
\Large
\begin{aligned}
F_\text{net} &= ma \\
&= m\frac{dv}{dt} \\
&= F_\text{ext} + v_\text{rel}\frac{dm}{dt}
\end{aligned}
$$

Therefore, 

$$\Large m\frac{dv}{dt}= F_\text{ext} + v_\text{rel}\frac{dm}{dt}$$

> **LEGEND:**
> $m$ - Mass of the rocket, including the fuel.
> $v$ - Velocity of the rocket.
> $F_\text{ext}$ - All the external forces acting on the rocket, which includes force of gravity and the drag force.
> $v_\text{rel}$ - The velocity of the gas being expelled relative to the rocket.
> $\frac{dm}{dt}$ - The burn rate of the rocket, which is how much fuel mass is burned over time.
