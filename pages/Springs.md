# Springs

Springs are coils of a material that can stretch and shrink but always wants to return to it's original positon.

The more you stretch or compress a sspring, the greater the force exerted by the spring.

**Equilibrium Position** - The orignal position that a spring wants to return to

## Hooke's Law
The force exerted by the spring to return to it's equilibrium position is

$$\Huge F_s = -kx$$
> **LEGEND:**
> $-$ - Negative means the force is a restoring force â€” if you stretch the spring out, it wants to contract.
> $k$ - Spring constant, which depends on the spring's material makup. This is measured in $N/m$.
> $x$ - Distance that the end of the spring is pull away from the equilibrium position.

The potential energy of a spring is

$$\Huge U_s = \frac{1}{2}kx^2$$
> **LEGEND:**
> $-$ - Negative means the force points towards the equilibrium position.
> $k$ - Spring constant, which depends on the spring's material makup.
> $x$ - Distance that the end of the spring is pull away from the equilibrium position.

> **NOTE:**
> This is derived from the work done by compressing a spring. Since the work is the area under the curve of a force vs displacement graph and this type of graph for a spring is a triangle,
