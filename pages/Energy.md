# Energy

There are different types of energy in the world. Energy is the capacity for doing work. 

Energy can be transferred from one type to another, such as the potential energy of a object on a cliff transferring to kinetic energy as the object falls off the cliff.

Energy is a scalar quantity and is measured in joules.

**Joule** ($J$) - A unit of energy.

## [[Potential Energy]]

## [[Kinetic Energy]]

## Power

**Power** ($P$ : Scalar | $W$, $\frac{J}{s}$) - The rate at which work is done or the rate at which energy is transferred from one form to another.

**Watt** ($W$) - A unit of power.
