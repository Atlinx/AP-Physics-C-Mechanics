# Center of Mass

Every object has a center of mass, and it is where the object can be simplified down to a point mass. An object can balance on it's center of mass.

To find the center of mass of an object made up of small objects you use

$$\large x_\text{com} = \frac{m_1x_1 + m_2x_2 + m_3x_3 + \ldots}{m_1 + m_2 + m_3 + \ldots}$$

> **LEGEND:**
> $x_\text{com}$ - Center of mass of an object relative to a point.
> $x_1, x_2, x_3, \ldots$ - The distance of each object relative to a point.
> $m_1, m_2, m_3, \ldots$ - The mass of each object.

> **NOTE:**
> Normally the point that you take all the distances with respect to is the position of one of the masses, which we can call $m_p$. This makes it easier to calculate $x_\text{com}$ since the term for $m_p$ in the numerator will be $0$.

## Center of Mass with Calc

If you want to find the mass of an object without uniform mass, then

$$\Large x_\text{com} = \frac{\int_a^b x \cdot dm}{M}$$
